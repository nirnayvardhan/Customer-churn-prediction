# Bank Customer Churn Prediction


Customer churn has become a big issue in many banks because it costs a lot more to acquire a new customer than retaining existing ones. With the use of a customer churn prediction model possible churners in a bank can be identified, and as a result the bank can take some action to prevent them from leaving.
